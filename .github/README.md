# MOBIQ ERP (fictional)

This is the code repository of **MOBIQ**, a fictional ERP vendor for furniture and kitchen retail (Musterhaus Software GmbH). It is part of the [MOBIQ evaluation dataset](https://github.com/neuraldoc-ai/mobiq) used by [neuraldoc](https://github.com/neuraldoc-ai/neuraldoc-dashboard) as showcase and test case. All companies, people and contents are fictional; code, commit messages and the repository's own [README](../README.md) are in German, as they would be at a German customer.
